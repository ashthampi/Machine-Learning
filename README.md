Data Loading and Preprocessing: Handles categorical features by one-hot encoding. Standardizes numerical features.
Model Training and Evaluation: Splits the data into training and testing sets. Trains various regression models (linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and support vector regression). Evaluates the models using metrics like R-squared, mean squared error, and mean absolute error. Compares the performance based on the evaluation metrics.
